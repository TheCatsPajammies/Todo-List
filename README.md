## To Do List Tutorial
This is a React Tutorial from the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning). The purpose of this tutorial is to make a simple todo list application and show the structure of a React Application.

## Instructions
As of 2/12/21 I've completed up to the "React interactivity: Editing, filtering, conditional rendering."  I'm currently using npm for installation so if you're interested in trying out the code that's written so far, here's how to install it.

*Once the files are downloaded into a directory, cd into the file directory and type the commands inside the quotes.

*If you're using npm, type "npm i" - then press enter.

*Once the packages are installed, type "npm start" - then press enter.

*The application can be viewed locally in your browser at http://localhost:3000
